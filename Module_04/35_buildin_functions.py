You've already seen a few built-in functions, such as:

int 
str 
sum 
print 
range 

There's quite a few built-in functions that we can use—and they do a variety of things. Here's a few more examples:

len(my_list)  gives you the length of the list my_list —it also works with tuples and strings;
max(my_list)  gives you the maximum number in my_list  (there's also min(my_list) )
round(my_decimal)  rounds my_decimal  according to maths rules (e.g. 3.5 gets rounded up to 4; 3.49 gets rounded down to 3)
